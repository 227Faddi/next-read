# NextRead : [Visit Here](https://next-read-app.netlify.app/).

NextRead is a web application designed to help users find book recommendations based on their interests. By entering a topic or genre, users can browse through a selection of books fetched from the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api). The app displays book titles, authors, and cover images, allowing users to easily discover their next great read.
