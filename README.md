NextRead is a web application designed to help users find book recommendations based on their interests. By entering a topic or genre, users can browse through a selection of books fetched from the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api). The app displays book titles, authors, and cover images, allowing users to easily discover their next great read. The application includes authentication using Passport.js with Google OAuth2 and local strategy, enabling secure user logins.

**Try the App:** You can log in as a guest using the following credentials:
- **Email:** guest@gmail.com
- **Password:** helloworld

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api), EJS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Passport.js.

## Optimizations
Model-View-Controller: Implemented the MVC architecture to structure the application efficiently. This approach enhances maintainability and scalability by separating concerns and organizing code into distinct layers for better management and scalability.

Authentication: Added user authentication using Passport.js with Google OAuth20 and local strategy to enhance security and user management.

Status Management: Integrated features that allow users to change and modify the status of each book.


## Lessons Learned
During the development of NextRead, I improved my knowledge of API integration and handling various data fetching scenarios, which enhanced my ability to create functional and user-friendly web applications.
